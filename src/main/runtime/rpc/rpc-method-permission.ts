/**
 * What a method lets its caller do to this Orca, declared on every method definition.
 *
 * The dispatcher grants each caller kind a set of these (rpc-caller-scope.ts), so a new method
 * cannot ship without someone deciding which callers may reach it.
 *
 * `workspace` means the caller can run code as this host's user: it opens terminals and starts
 * agents here. Anything a terminal command could do anyway (browsing directories, installing
 * skills, changing launch env or SSH targets) is therefore not a boundary for a `workspace`
 * caller. Those stay separate tiers so a narrower row (an SSH host's CLI) can refuse them; mobile
 * is gated by its own method-name allowlist instead. For a paired runtime client the real
 * boundaries are `desktop-control` (granted per device at pairing) and `pairing-admin` (never
 * granted to it).
